      Once, a powerful lion in the forest was fed one animal each day to avoid hunting too many at once. One day, a clever rabbit was sent to the lion. On his way, the rabbit hatched a plan and told the lion of a stronger lion in the forest. Furious, the lion demanded to be taken to this rival. The rabbit led him to a well, claiming the other lion lived there. When the lion peered into the water and saw his reflection, he thought it was the rival lion, and in his anger, he jumped in and drowned.
